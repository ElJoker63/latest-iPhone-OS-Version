# latest-iPhone-OS-Version

This is a simple python script that works on macOS, windows, and linux that scrapes the ipsw.me page based on your iPhone that you select in the program. Do be aware that you must do "pip  install beautifulsoup4" and "pip install requests" to use this script. Note: If you are running macOS or Linux, you type "pip3" instead of "pip" in the terminal.
