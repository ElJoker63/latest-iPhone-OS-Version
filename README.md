# latest-iPhone-OS-Version

This is a simple python script that works on macOS, Windows, and Linux that scrapes the ipsw.me page based on your iPhone that you select in the program. 

Do be aware that you must do:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


macOS and Linux users can use:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
